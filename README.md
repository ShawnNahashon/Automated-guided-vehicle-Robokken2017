Automated guided vehicle used in automated storage and retrieval
#Design problem: Design, fabricate and program an autonomous machine to be used in an automated storage and retrieval system
 For this design problem, we decided to use an AGV (autonomous guided vehicle). The AGV will resemble a vehicle, it'll have 4 wheels driven by 4 DC motors. It will also consist of a robotic arm for picking and placing components, the motion of the robotic arm will be provided by servo motors. A carriage will also be incorporated to facilitate the storage functionality.
